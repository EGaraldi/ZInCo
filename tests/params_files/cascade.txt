%First of all, tell me the type of process you want me to do setting to 1 the related variable and setting to 0 all the others
RunType			cascade

%Now tell me where to find the high-resolution ICs, their name and the number of file they are made of
HighResICsDir		../ICs
HighResICsName		TestICs_Np128_Nf1
HighResICsFilesNumber	1
HighResICsFilesType	1

%   where I should save the output
OutputDir		../output
OutputFilesNumber	1
OutputFilesType		1

%   the number of cubic sections in which the simulation box should be divided into
CubesPerSide		64

%   and the number of resolution levels you want (if you perform a dilution, LevelsNumber will be set to 1) and the number 
%    of species you are processing, which must be stored in the first SpeciesNumber particle types.
%    Remember that the following relation must hold true: LevelsNumber*SpeciesNumber <= 6
LevelsNumber		3
SpeciesNumber		2

%(for dilution you can stop here)

%Now, for each resolution level you must specify its size, i.e. how many bubbles it will have *for each bubble of the above level*. 
%i.e. if Level0Size = 2 and Level1Size = 3, then Level1 will have in total 2*3 bubbles. Note that only the 
% first LevelsNumber values will be considered (ignored for zoom)
Level0Size		1
Level1Size		2
Level2Size		2
Level3Size		3
Level4Size		3
Level5Size		3

%At the same way now I need the radius of the bubbles of each level. Thay must decrease from level 0 to level 5
% (in the ZOOM procedure, the radii will be adjust mantaining their ratio to the last one)
% NOTE that the particles which do not belong to any level will be ignored
Level0BubbleRadius	200%000
Level1BubbleRadius	20 %00
Level2BubbleRadius	5 %00
Level3BubbleRadius	100
Level4BubbleRadius	30
Level5BubbleRadius	10

%and also the number of cubic sections I should merge for each resolution level (use 0 to identify where I should copy the particles,
% use -1 where I should ignore the particles).
Level0CubesPerSide	2
Level1CubesPerSide	1
Level2CubesPerSide	0
Level3CubesPerSide	2
Level4CubesPerSide	1
Level5CubesPerSide	0

%If you are performing a ZOOM, please tell me where to find the diluted ICs, their name and the number of file they are made of

LowResICsDir		../ICs
LowResICsName		TestICs_Np128_Nf1.dilution32
LowResICsFilesNumber	1
LowResICsFilesType	1

%    where to find the snapshot, its name and the number of file it is made of
SnapshotDir		../SNAP
SnapshotName		TestSNAP_Np128D32_Nf1
SnapshotFilesNumber	1
SnapshotFilesType	1

%    the x, y, z coordinates of the center of the (spherical) region of interest in the snapshot						
x_c			50.0
y_c			50.0
z_c			50.0

%Finally, you should set a seed for the random production of the cascade (use -1 if you want me to use the current time)
CascadeRandomSeed	452236

%and a maximum number of iteration for each bubble in the loop which places the bubbles
CascadeMaxIter		10000
