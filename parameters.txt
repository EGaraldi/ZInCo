%Dilution		0
%Zoom			1
%Cascade			0

%Now tell me where to find the high-resolution ICs, their name and the number of file they are made of

%   the number of cubic sections in which the simulation box should be divided into
CubesPerSide		512

%   and the number of resolution levels you want (if you perform a dilution, LevelsNumber will be set to 1) and the number 
%    of species you are processing, which must be stored in the first SpeciesNumber particle types.
%    Remember that the following relation must hold true: LevelsNumber*SpeciesNumber <= 6
LevelsNumber		3
SpeciesNumber		2

%(for dilution you can stop here)

%Now, for each resolution level you must specify its size, i.e. how many bubbles each level will contain. Note that only the 
% first LevelsNumber values will be considered (ignored for zoom)
Level0Size		1
Level1Size		3
Level2Size		3
Level3Size		3
Level4Size		3
Level5Size		3

%At the same way now I need the radius of the bubbles of each level. Thay must decrease from level 0 to level 5
% (in the ZOOM procedure, the radii will be adjust mantaining their ratio to the last one)
% NOTE that the particles which do not belong to any level will be ignored
Level0BubbleRadius	200000
Level1BubbleRadius	3000
Level2BubbleRadius	1000
Level3BubbleRadius	100
Level4BubbleRadius	30
Level5BubbleRadius	10

%and also the number of cubic sections I should merge for each resolution level (use 0 to identify where I should copy the particles,
% use -1 where I should ignore the particles).
Level0CubesPerSide	2
Level1CubesPerSide	1
Level2CubesPerSide	0

%Finally, you should set a seed for the random production of the cascade (use -1 if you want me to use the current time)
